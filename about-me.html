	<h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul> I was born in San Jose CA in September 12, 2004. I am currently 14 years old transfering to Independce High School. But during my freshman year of highschool I went to Yerba Buena High School. Another thing is I am very passionate about taking photos. </ul>
<ul> Some interesting things about me is that I love boba. My favorite drink from there is passionfruit green tea with white pearl. It is kind of an addiction, since I usually get boba once or twice a week. Furthermore, I am mix Cambodian, Thai, and Lao but I don't speak thai nor lao only khmer. Khmer is Cambodia's native language but it isn't my first language. My first language is english than it goes to khmer. I'm not that good but I can understand most of my native language. </ul> </div>
